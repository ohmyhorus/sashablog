    <h1><p><b>Who I am?</b></h1></br>
        <div>
        <h2><p><em>I'm a boy from Milan, my passions vary from classical to heavy music,</br>
        from Canova marbles to contemporary tacky (which I love with all my heart, this is my guilty pleasure)</br>
        from novels and fanfiction, to psychology (Jung), philosophy (I share the thick mustache with Nietzche),</br>
        sociology (Bauman) and weirdo stuff (guilty pleasure n 2) like Jodorowsky and Castaneda.</br>
        By pure chance and advice from one of my relatives, I began to get curious about front-ends and here I am,</br>
        to create a site.</br>
        <p>Ah, true, I forgot to mention that sometimes I do something like "model" for my friend.</br>
        From classic tacky stuff, to more elaborate things of my and my friend mind.</br>
        Sometimes give birth to truly bizarre ideas and scenarios.</br>
        It all started from the fact that she didn't know who to take the pictures of, she was bored photographing food,</br> 
        still life or landscapes, becouse Instagram was full of these photos back in 2010-11, and me offered like a volunteer,</br>
        I know she doesn't like to publish photos, because she does it for herself, but I decided, hanging out,</br>
        a bit also out of boredom and why not, to experiment with "creation", to give birth to a blog/site, where I collect all the photos taken,</br>
        as a tribute to his work done practically for free (where do you see such a thing nowadays?).</em></br></h2>
        <h2><b><p>Let the journey begin... </br>
        (PS. I decided to divide all the photos, linking them with alchemical elements,</br>
        instead of seasons of the year.)</b></p>

          <p> Alchemical element = sulfur, atmospheric black metal. In terms of human body, it represented the soul.</br> 
          In terms of the tria prima, sulfur was seen as the middling element connecting salt (high) and mercury (low).</p>

            <p>Gold, sun, heat.</br>
              In alchemic and Hermetic traditions, suns are used to symbolize a variety of concepts,<br/>
              much like the sun in astrology. Suns can correspond to gold, citrinitas, generative masculine principles, imagery of "the king",<br/> 
              or Apollo, the fiery spirit or sulfur,the divine spark in man,nobility, or incorruptibility. Recurring images of specific solar motifs<br/> 
              can be found in the form of a "Dark" or "Black Sun", or a green lion devouring a sun (wikipedia).<br/></p>

              <p><em>"If I get to know her then I might save her </br>
                  Stars in your eyes, let the moon talk </br>
                  I could stay a while 'fore I move on </br>
                  Hoodie sleeves up, let the mask off </br>
                  Mixed our tears on the asphalt"</em> 
                The basic alchemical slogan 'solve et coagula', is the process of dissolving (moon) in order to coagulate (sun) the essential,</br> 
                each time refining the process more and more until it is pure spirit. <br>
