<h1><p style="color:white;"><b><font size="7">Who I am?</font></b></font></h1></br>
<hr/>
<h2><p style="color:white;"><em>I'm a boy from Milan, my passions vary from classical to heavy music,</br>
from Canova marbles to contemporary tacky (which I love with all my heart, this is my guilty pleasure)</br>
from novels and fanfiction, to psychology (Jung), philosophy (I share the thick mustache with Nietzche),</br>
sociology (Bauman) and weirdo stuff (guilty pleasure n 2) like Jodorowsky and Castaneda.</br>
By pure chance and advice from one of my relatives, I began to get curious about front-ends and here I am,</br>
to create a site.</br>
<hr/>
<p style="color:white;">Ah, true, I forgot to mention that sometimes I do something like "model" for my friend.</br>
From classic tacky stuff, to more elaborate things of my and my friend mind.</br>
Sometimes give birth to truly bizarre ideas and scenarios.</br>
It all started from the fact that she didn't know who to take the pictures of, she was bored photographing food,</br> 
still life or landscapes, becouse Instagram was full of these photos back in 2010-11, and me offered like a volunteer,</br>
I know she doesn't like to publish photos, because she does it for herself, but I decided, hanging out,</br>
a bit also out of boredom and why not, to experiment with "creation", to give birth to a blog/site, where I collect all the photos taken,</br>
as a tribute to his work done practically for free (where do you see such a thing nowadays?).</em></br></h2>
<b><p style="color:white;"><font size="10">Let the journey begin... </br>
(PS. I decided to divide all the photos, linking them with alchemical elements,</br>
instead of seasons of the year.)</font></b></p></div></font>
